    "content": "Monsters    Chapter 1 - rise o ’  ChaMpion of styx       “ Your desires are realized, now come child, entertain me, ”  She whispered, her   words lay thick with malice and cruelty.       A young man stood in the shallow waters of a small, secluded beach, taking in the   scenery. Tropical water ran past his ankles and up the fine white sand that called the   beach home. He felt an odd sense of calm standing there in the shallows, it was   almost  as if   they called to him, asking him to stay. Content, he sat down in the cool   water, enjoying the soothing melody sung by the crashing waves. It was as if all the   pain and misery was slowly being washed away, freeing his mind to think clearly.     He felt li ttle desire to leave, why would he? A serene beach, with clear and warm   weather, white sand, and crystal - clear water. It was perfect. It was peaceful.    The portrait was disturbed as a shadow passed overhead, arresting his attention.    A figure stood above him ; their visage obscured by the sunlight. They spoke with a   sweet and gentle voice.    “ Who are you? ”       The image of the beautiful beach shattered, replaced by a painful burning sensation   in his chest.    He gasped for air   as his eyes shot open. T he sky above was  no longer clear blue   but a faded black with streaks of orange, cast by the rising sun. He felt a knot   release in his stomach and quickly rolled over before vomiting a mixture of bile and   saliva.      Warmth crept from his centre and out across his body and fee ling returned to his   nerves.    With fierce determination, he clambered to his feet. It was like watching a newborn   standing for the first time, with his legs wobbling beneath him  –   dangerously close to   collapsing.    He spluttered as he tried to breathe. Shocke d and confused by the recent events he   could scarcely remember. The pain in his lungs hadn ’ t faded, seemingly getting   worse with each breath, but he didn ’ t care. He racked his brain, desperately trying to   remember what  had  happened.    Worried, he spun around , only for his legs to lag and buckle beneath him. He fell   into the ashen dirt, sending a cloud of the substance skyward.   Refusing to accept   this minor setback, he struggled on, desperate to at least see himself sitting and after   a moment of near futile st rain. He made it.    He gulped and immediately began to hack and splutter trying to clean his mouth   from the foul - tasting ash that had mixed with his saliva."

    "content": "Amidst his fit ,   he began to remember. The memories surged into his mind, slowly   building until they  came crashing down, bearing emotions he ’ d sooner forget than   relive.    He could remember them: Rough waves throwing a ship in the dead of night, a   heartless melody sung over dying screams, the self - sacrifice of a friend to spare the   rest, the whistle of stea m and clanking of iron as gears moved into place, feral   beasts stalking prey as it crossed their domain, jagged cliffs that touched the sky,   dark twisting tunnels filled with horrors and finally the blistering heat of flowing lava.    He summited the volcano  alone.     No . He wasn ’ t alone . He racked his brain further. Someone was there; he  had   spoken   to them   –   their  lips mov ed but the words were lost.    W hat were they saying?     He probed his mind; a visage of the silent speaker flickered into focus. Skin purple,   rem inding him of the wisteria flower he ’ d seen only in books. And t hen suddenly,  the   only thought left was   pain.    The young man grabbed his neck, finding nothing but the cool sensation of his own   skin. The collar that once embraced it gone. He ’ d done it, he ’ d  destroyed the   artefact, he was free.    Something cold ran down his face. Quickly, he wiped at it, finding a singular tear   clinging to his finger.    What right did he have to celebrate his freedom, when the friends he had held dear   were now dead. Regret crept  in and he could do nothing but stare onwards with a   bleak expression.    The memories began to order themselves. There had been nine of them at the   beginning of their journey. A journey none of them had agreed to but were forced on   anyways, collared like dogs   to make sure they obeyed. A great evil threatened the   land, and it was they who were chosen to save it. A group unfit for such an   endeavour.    Now Kairan stood alone, the sole survivor.    He sat amongst the ash, playing with it to distract himself from the pa in. It drained   from between his fingers as he recollected more of his thoughts. The king   had   said   to destroy the artefact, that would save his people ...   but it was that person who   appeared when the artefact was destroyed, why? In the end nothing had changed,    all that suffering for nothing.      An expendable pawn for a king he knew not the name of.    Subconsciously, his fingers curled into a fist, squeezing the ash in his hand. The   bones in his fingers began to ache.    The anger began to rise, burning for the one who   had sentenced him to this fate.    He slammed his fist into the ground, a useless expression of rage, but it made him   feel slightly better. However, that feeling quickly changed, as the hand that struck the   dirt  couldn ’ t have been   his. In fact, it didn ’ t eve n look human. Charcoal grey, with   rigid and flaky skin.    He scrambled backwards, spurring his mind to rationalize what he saw but the hand   followed. Of course, it would, it was his after all. But he denied it, every fibre of his   being denied it."

    "content": "Panic began   to set in but there was no denying the truth. It responded to his every   whim, whether he wanted it to or not.    With frantic fervour, he examined himself, desperately wanting to know what he   was, but  fearful of the truth .    Yet, a part of him already knew.    He   wasn ’ t human anymore.    With panic barely held at bay, he grabbed a hold of his face. His fingers were like   beach mites clawing their way through sand, as they scrambled along his face. They   searched, skittering across the flatness. From the bottom they fou nd nothing that   resembled a chin, desperate they darted upwards, finding a mouth. He felt relief as   the fingers forced their way inside; two rows of sharp blades meant to be teeth sliced   his shaking fingers.     Hesitantly, they left his mouth and continued f urther up, eventually passing his eyes.   He could feel his heartbeat pounding in his ears. That couldn ’ t be correct. There   should have been a nose first. With shaking hands, he pressed against the flesh just   above his mouth. Nothing, albeit two small slits,   cut into the flesh that would flare   with each exhale.    An unsettling, nauseating feeling filled his stomach, but he couldn ’ t fight the desire   to know more. Just how much had he been disfigured.     The hands drifted higher, past the eyes until they struck som ething else. It was big,   stretching out around the entirety of his head and just out of view. It was  as if   some   tumorous growth clung to his head.    With unchecked panic he jumped to his feet, only to hunch over like some   malformed imp. He was alone, but eve n so, wanted to hide the freak that he ’ d   become.    While doing his best to cover himself, he searched desperately for a reflection.   Anything that could reveal to him what he was, until a light caught his eye, reflecting   off the small stones strewn between th e ashen dirt. He began frantically scooping   stones together, but it was of no use, they showed him nothing.    He turned his gaze to the shadow brought about by the rising sun. Light washed   over his naked back, revealing what he was.    A pit formed in his stoma ch, and  a tightness seized his throat.     The shadow before him was human oid , maybe a bit tall and broad, but the real   difference was the mushroom it wore for a head.    “ I ’ m a monster, ”  he said dejected, as he fell onto his hands and knees ... “ They did   this to m e, ”  he muttered with a growl, the figure in his memories flashed him a   malicious smile as their conversation drew to a close.    A new glint caught his eye, sharper than the last. Momentarily distracted from his   plight, Kairan began sifting through the loose  dirt, unearthing a sword. The metallic   lustre of its hilt was long gone, replaced with an infection of rust. He pressed a thumb   into the thick layer of dirt that clung to the scabbard, prying a chunk off. His   suspicions were true; the pattern engraved on t he scabbard belonged to the sword   he ’ d carried.    Rust and dirt spewed out as he unsheathed the blade,  similar to   the hilt, it had been   consumed by rust; to the point the tip had broken off. He held it to the light.  What"

    "content": "happened? What did they do?   The thoug ht was quickly squashed as he began to   rejoice. At least one partner had made it.    Yet that happiness did not last, quickly replaced by anger one  more .    “ You did nothing, ”  he snarled at the rusted blade. With misplaced rage he clumsily   climbed to his feet, r eady to throw the sword off the mountain side,  “ You couldn ’ t   save a single one of my friends! ”  he yelled, swinging his arm, but just couldn ’ t let go   of the sword.     “ I couldn ’ t save a single one of my friends. ”  He fell to his knees again, letting the   sword  slip from his grasp.    He sat at the edge of the cliff for a while, quietly staring at the world around him.   Lost in thought he never took notice of his once damaged eyes now working   correctly  –   far better than any human.    Beneath him, at the volcano ’ s base,  was a line of destroyed trees growing anew   amidst the debris of the lahar   –   almost parasitic in nature, as they latched onto the   surrounding rockface. T he absence of soil staving off their advance.     His eyes drifted upwards.  Far in the distance ,   barely vis ible ,   were the Twin peaks,   two giant mountains that stood above the rest of their mountain range.     But  something else caught his eye  –   people. He could see the marks of civilization   between the Twin peaks and  the volcano ; there was even a town just a day ’ s travel   away.     H is chest tightened , if   only   he hadn ’ t been so focused on reaching the volcano,   maybe he could have saved at least one friend.    “ What do I do   now ?”  Kairan mumbled to himself, watching the miniature dots mov e   about in the fields around the nearby town.    As the sun pulled higher into the sky, he climbed to his feet, his eyes fixated on the   drop before him.  An emptiness cast in shadow, a deep void that called for him . His   right foot shifted forward, pushing a st one over the edge. He never saw it land but he   heard it striking the rock beneath with a resounding echo.    Kairan closed his eyes and drew a long breath; he held onto the air until his lungs   began to burn. He released the air slowly before taking another br eath.     Just one step.    “ Coward, ”  he spat and pulled himself from the edge. He could feel a prickle run   along his back as if the scorning gazes of his friends were digging into him. They ’ d   have had every right to chastise him for  such a   pathetic display.    He  sheathed his blade; a decision had been made for him. He tore off the remaining   shred of cloth that had once made up his shirt and tied it to the cross - guard.   Finished, he turned back to the volcano ’ s rim and jammed the sword into a pile of   rocks swarming  with black mushrooms, before taking a step back. A final grave for   the  nine   who died for nothing  –   a droplet in the pond that was the king ’ s mounting   sacrifices.    A light breeze blew past, tugging on the two loose ends of cloth.    He struggled to find somethi ng to say, opening his mouth several times  only to   close it . Offering prayer felt wrong as he wasn ’ t religious ,   so what was left? Just a   simple goodbye?    He looked down at his hands.  “ There are darker designs at play. The nightmare we   were subject to has ye t to end. Perhaps growing more twisted. ”  He paused for a"

    "content": "moment, turning back to the grave; his eyes narrowed.  “ It is clear to me now; I can   only hope there is  a  cold spot in hell waiting. ”  His hands balled into fists and his jaw   clenched.   “ N o fortress wil l be his sanctuary. The vast seas won ’ t slow me, and his   army will prove a futile defence to  cower   behind. ”   He turned northward, to the   horizon, his  hardening  gaze stretching beyond the borders of the island and across   the ocean.   T o Dyovaris .  The place whe re it all began.      The goal set .   All that was left was to take the first step and descend from the   volcano summit.    A trial proven rather arduous. Near moments after starting, the strain suffered by his   muscles forced him to take a break, a theme present thr oughout the entirety of  his    descent. It bewildered him, his new body seemed perfectly fine  –   in fact, it should   have excelled at such basic  task,  yet each step was a struggle. After  harrowing  three   hours he collapsed against a rock and slid slowly to the f loor.    “ Pathetic, ”  he huffed, barely able to keep his breathing steady. He rolled onto his   back.  “ All that talk, and I can ’ t even climb down a mountain, ”  he moaned. It was   somehow harder than when he had climbed the volcano moments prior, something   he ’ d man aged to do while half - starved and ... It dawned on him. The rumble from his   stomach confirmed his suspicion. He was starving, a realization that came three   hours too late.     With great difficulty he pushed himself up, pausing his descent in favour of even the   t iniest scraps that might have grown on the volcano ’ s cliffs.    All he found was disappointment.    “ Fine, ”  he said finally as he glared at the clump of dried leaves meant to be a bush   that he was currently crouched over.  “ You survived the eruption only to be ea ten by   me ... I ’ m talking to a plant, ”  he said with a sigh.  “ Hunger makes a man do strange   things. ”  With little motivation, he grabbed a handful of leaves and shoved them into   his mouth, all the while telling himself it was spinach.     He spat them out immediate ly and frantically started wiping his tongue. Not only did   they taste horrid   with an acidic aftertaste , but they were covered in fuzz that would   prick the tongue as you chewed.    Dejected with the little sustenance he managed to squeeze from the leaves, he   r eturned to the long climb down. His stomach would have no choice but to hold on   until greener pastures were found.     It took every hour of sunlight for him to reach the base of the volcano, but the   journey wasn ’ t over yet. One thing remained before he ’ d all ow himself the option of   rest. He sat, heaving as he collected his breath. Above him was the cave that had   saved them from the eruption, thanks to it being elevated high above the ground and   the surrounding rockface slanting away from the entrance.    Ready,  he began to climb. A mixture of emotions began to swell; sorrow, dread,   regret but most powerful of all was hatred. This is where he ’ d buried James. Weak   from blood - loss and starvation, the extreme heat of passing lava was the reason   James never saw the mo rning.    Kairan stared into the cave ’ s black maw, contemplating. Eventually he reached an   answer before taking a deep breath and plunging inwards. The sounds from the   outside world disappeared, leaving him with nothing but the tapping of his bare feet   agains t the stone."

    "content": "He turned a corner.  “ Hey James, ”  he said.  The words were  caught in his throat.   “ How - ”  he froze, the sight before him made his stomach churn. He rushed towards   James ’  grave. His legs buckled under the stress, and he fell face first into the emp ty   pile of rocks but without hesitation he began digging, forcing his way in between the   rocks until his nails scrapped the bottom.    The grave was empty; the rocks had been blasted apart, some even melted. The   ground was a series of scorch marks and now coo led molten rock. His remorse   changed to shock and then worry. A morbid thought squirmed its way into his mind.   Something had eaten James. He sat back from the pile, unsure. At least now there   was no chance of James possibly coming back. Kairan ’ s lips pulle d into a snarl and   his jaw tightened as he remembered something. It was a foul memory that broke   him. Better that James did not have to suffer through that fate too.    To keep the demons of his mind at bay, Kairan distracted himself with the marks left   by the beast. It was not a large creature, maybe a  handful of   centimetres shorter   than himself, if the comparison between their feet meant anything. It was also   bipedal ba sed off the pattern of the prints.     The footprints  were unnaturally shaped, matching no beast he ’ d seen before.   Thin   by the heel before spreading out by the toes  –   though it was more accurate to call   them talons  –   there was also no evidence of an arch. The   foot was almost   symmetrical.     As he explored more, he  came to the realization   something truly   strange   had   occurred . Close to the grave were these scratches and soot marks, then the   footprints  only  appeared about two metres away: facing towards the grave. Then   some kind of  struggle   that involved the wall before the creature finally t ook off and   fled .    The setting sun, and ensuing darkness, put an end to his investigation. Without   much choice and exhau sted, he decided to turn in for the night. He wasn ’ t about to   sleep inside the cave but also knew that outside would be far worse; in the end he   decided to stay near the entrance, just shy of the two moon ’ s light.    He settled himself against the wall, cross ing his arms and tucking his legs to stave   off the biting chill.    The night seemed to drift by silently, no beasts made a commotion, even the night   critters were uncharacteristically still; mice hid in their hovels while the owls kept to   their roosts. There   was a thick tension in the air, a fear had been burned into every   living thing that called the forest home. Just what horror could disrupt an entire   forest ’ s ecological habits?    While waiting for sleep to take hold, he reflected on the day, but his mind ev entually   betrayed him, dredging up images of the accursed throne room . The mark of when   his life had started to fall apart    It was a vast room, the only thing bigger that Kairan had seen was an academy hall   but despite its grandiose size, the throne room wa s relatively bare. The decorations   were limited, a handful of banners bearing different coats of arms, but that was to be   expected. The room was built in such a way that it pushed your vision toward the   throne, and any additional clutter would have detract ed from th e throne ’ s weight . The   throne was gold en with accents   of  white, crafted to mimic a flock of doves taking   flight. Each dove had a small red jewel for an eye, that stared out lifelessly."
